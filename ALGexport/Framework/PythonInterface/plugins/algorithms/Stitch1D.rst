Stitches single histogram `Matrix Workspaces <MatrixWorkspace>`__
together outputing a stitched Matrix Workspace. This algorithm is a
wrapper over `Stitch1DMD <Stitch1DMD>`__.

The workspaces must be histogrammed. Use
`ConvertToHistogram <ConvertToHistogram>`__ on workspaces prior to
passing them to this algorithm.
