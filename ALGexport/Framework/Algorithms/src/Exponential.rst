.. properties:: Exponential

The algorithm will apply the exponential function (i.e. :math:`e^y`) to
the data and associated errors from a workspaces. The units of the
workspace are not updated, so the user must take care in the use of such
output workspaces. When acting on an event workspace, the output will be
a Workspace2D, with the default binning from the original workspace.
