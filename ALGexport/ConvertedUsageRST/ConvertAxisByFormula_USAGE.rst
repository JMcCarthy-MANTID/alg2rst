Squaring the X axis (assuming it is in Q) result =
ConvertAxisByFormula(InputsWorkspace="input", Axis="X",
Formula="x\*x",AxisTitle="QSquared",AxisUnit="Q2")

Other examples of the Math format are as follows:

-  Squaring - x^2
-  Square root - sqrt(x)
-  Cubing - x^3
-  Basic addition - y + 3
-  Brackets - (y+1)/20
-  Natural Log - ln(x)
-  Log 10 - log(x)
-  exponent - exp(y)
-  round to nearest integer - rint(y/10)
-  absolute value - abs(y-100)

Use can use x or y interchangeably to refer to the current axis value.
