This algorithm will correct detector efficiency according to the ILL INX program for time-of-flight data reduction.

A formula named "formula_eff" must be defined in the instrument parameters file.
The input workspace must be in DeltaE units.

The output data will be corrected as:
 <math>y = \frac{y}{eff}</math>
where <math>eff</math> is
 <math>eff = \frac{f(Ei - \Delta E)}{f(E_i)}</math>

The function <math>f</math> is defined as "formula_eff" in the IDF. To date this has been implemented at the ILL for ILL IN4, IN5 and IN6.
