The algorithm creates a new 2D workspace containing the first maxima (minima) for each spectrum, as well as their X boundaries and error.
This is used in particular for single crystal as a quick way to find strong peaks. By default, the algorithm returns the maxima.

The [[Max]] and [[Min]] algorithms are just calls to the [[MaxMin]] algorithm, with the ShowMin flag set to true/false respectively.
