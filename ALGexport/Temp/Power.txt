The algorithm will raise the InputWorkspace to the power of the Exponent.
When acting on an event workspace, the output will be a Workspace2D, with the default binning from the original workspace.

== Errors ==

Defining the power algorithm as: <math>  y = \left ( a^b \right )  </math>, we can describe the error as: 
<math>s_{y} = by\left ( s_{a}/a \right )</math>, where <math>s_{y}</math> is the error in the result ''y'' and <math>s_{a}</math> is the error in the input ''a''.
