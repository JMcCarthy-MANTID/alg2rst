This algorithm will flag the detectors listed as masked([[IDetector]] isMasked() method) and will zero the data in the spectra related to those detectors.

All but the first property are optional and at least one of the must be set. If several are set, the first will be used.

The set of detectors to be masked can be given as a list of either spectrum numbers, detector IDs or workspace indices. The list should be set against the appropriate property.

==== Mask Detectors According To Instrument ====
If the input MaskedWorkspace is not a SpecialWorkspace2D object, this algorithm will check every detectors in input MaskedWorkspace's Instrument. 
If the detector is masked, then the corresponding detector will be masked in Workspace.

==== Mask Detectors According to Masking Workspace ====
If the input MaskedWorkspace is a [[MaskWorkspace]] object, i.e., masking workspace, then the algorithm will mask Workspace's detector according to the histogram data of the SpecialWorkspace2D object

=== Definition of Mask ===
* If a pixel is masked, it means that the data from this pixel won't be used. In the masking workspace (i.e., [[SpecialWorkspace2D]]), the corresponding value is 1. 
* If a pixel is NOT masked, it means that the data from this pixel will be used. In the masking workspace (i.e., [[SpecialWorkspace2D]]), the corresponding value is 0.

=== About Input Parameters ===
[[MaskDetectors]] supports various format of input to mask detectors, including
* Workspace indices
* Spectra
* Detectors
* [[MaskWorkspace]]
* General [[MatrixWorkspace]] other than [[MaskWorkspace]] (In this case, the mask will be extracted from this workspace)

==== Rules ====
Here are the rules for input information for masking
 1. At least one of the inputs must be specified.   
 2. Workspace indices and Spectra cannot be given at the same time. 
 3. [[MaskWorkspace]] and general [[MatrixWorkspace]] cannot be given at the same time. 
 4. When a general [[MatrixWorkspace]] is specified, then all detectors in a spectrum are treated as masked if the effective detector of that spectrum is masked. 
 5. The masks specified from 
   a) workspace indices/spectra
   b) detectors
   c) [[MaskWorkspace]]/general [[MatrixWorkspace]]
   will be combined by the ''plus'' operation.

=== Operations Involved in Masking ===
There are 2 operations to mask a detector and thus spectrum related
 1. Set the detector in workspace's instrument's ''parameter map'' to ''masked'';
 2. Clear the data associated with the spectrum with detectors that are masked;

=== Implementation ===
In the plan, the workflow to mask detectors should be
 1. Convert input detectors, workspace indices or spectra, and general [[MatrixWorkspace]] to a [[MaskWorkspace]];
 2. Mask detectors according to [[MaskWorkspace]];
 3. Clear data on all spectra, which have at least one detector that is masked.

=== Concern ===
* Speed!
