Loads an existing file of pre-calculated or measured absorption coefficients for the PEARL instrument.

If the file contains "t=" on the first line then the number following this is assumed to be the thickness in mm. The values in the second column are assumed to be <math>\alpha(t)</math>. Upon reading the file the <math>\alpha</math> values for transformed into attenuation coefficients via <math>\frac{I}{I_0} = exp(-\alpha * t)</math>.
 
If the file does not contain "t=" on the top line then the values are assumed to be calculated <math>\frac{I}{I_0}</math> values and are simply read in verbatim.
