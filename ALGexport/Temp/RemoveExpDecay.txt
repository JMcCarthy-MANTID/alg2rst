This algorithm removes the exponential time decay from a specified muon spectra. By default, all the spectra in a workspace will be corrected.

The formula for removing the exponential decay is given by:

:<math> NewData = (OldData\times{e^\frac{t}{\tau}})/N_0 - 1.0 </math>

where Ï„ is the muon lifetime (2.197019e-6 seconds). <math>N_0</math> is a fitted normalisation constant.
