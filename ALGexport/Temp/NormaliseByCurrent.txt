Normalises a workspace according to the good proton charge figure taken from the Input Workspace log data, which is stored in the workspace's [[Sample]] object). Every data point (and its error) is divided by that number.

== ISIS Calculation Details ==
The good proton charge '''gd_ptrn_chrg''' is an summed value that applies across all periods. It is therefore suitable to run NormaliseByProtonCharge for single-period workspaces, but gives incorrect normalisation for multi-period workspaces. If the algorithm detects the presences of a multi-period workspace, it calculates the normalisation slightly differently. It uses the '''current_period''' log property to index into the '''proton_charge_by_period''' log data array property.

=== EventWorkspaces ===
If the input workspace is an [[EventWorkspace]], then the output will be as well. Weighted events are used to scale by the current (see the [[Divide]] algorithm, which is a child algorithm being used).
