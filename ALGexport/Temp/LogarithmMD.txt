This executes the natural logarithm operation on a MDHistoWorkspace.

The signal <math>a</math> becomes <math> f = log(a) </math>

The error <math>da</math> becomes <math> df^2 = a^2 / da^2 </math>

This algorithm cannot be run on a [[MDEventWorkspace]]. Its equivalent on a [[MatrixWorkspace]] is called [[Logarithm]].
