Strips the log property values of "inst_abrv", "run_number", "user_name", "run_title" and "hd_dur" from the specified run files, and compiles a TableWorkspace of the result.

Uses multiple calls to [[CreateLogPropertyTable]] create the final result table.

== Limitations ==

Currently, only ISIS instruments with runs that have the ''full'' list of log properties are supported.  [[CreateLogPropertyTable]] is available to those users who wish to "brew their own" version of this algorithm.
