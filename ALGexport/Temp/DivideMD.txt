Divide two [[MDHistoWorkspace]]'s or a MDHistoWorkspace and a scalar.

The error of <math> f = a / b </math> is propagated with <math> df^2 = f^2 * (da^2 / a^2 + db^2 / b^2) </math>

* '''MDHistoWorkspace / MDHistoWorkspace'''
** The operation is performed element-by-element.
* '''MDHistoWorkspace / Scalar'''
** Every element of the MDHistoWorkspace is divided by the scalar.
* '''Scalar / MDHistoWorkspace'''
** This is not allowed.
* '''[[MDEventWorkspace]]'s'''
** This operation is not supported, as it is not clear what its meaning would be.
