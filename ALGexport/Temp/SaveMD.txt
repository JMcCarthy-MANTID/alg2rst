Save a [[MDEventWorkspace]] to a .nxs file. The workspace's current box structure and entire list of events is preserved.
The resulting file can be loaded via [[LoadMD]].

If you specify MakeFileBacked, then this will turn an in-memory workspace to a file-backed one. Memory will be released as it is written to disk.

If you specify UpdateFileBackEnd, then any changes (e.g. events added using the PlusMD algorithm) will be saved to the file back-end.
