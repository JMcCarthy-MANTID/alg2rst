Multiply two [[MDHistoWorkspace]]'s or a MDHistoWorkspace and a scalar.

The error of <math> f = a * b </math> is propagated with <math>df^2 = f^2 * (da^2 / a^2 + db^2 / b^2)</math>

* '''MDHistoWorkspace * MDHistoWorkspace'''
** The operation is performed element-by-element.
* '''MDHistoWorkspace * Scalar''' or '''Scalar * MDHistoWorkspace'''
** Every element of the MDHistoWorkspace is multiplied by the scalar.
* '''[[MDEventWorkspace]]'s'''
** This operation is not supported, as it is not clear what its meaning would be.
