== Description ==

This algorithm requires a workspace that is both in d-spacing, but has also been preprocessed by the [[CrossCorrelate]] algorithm.  In this first step you select one spectrum to be the reference spectrum and all of the other spectrum are cross correlated against it.  Each output spectrum then contains a peak whose location defines the offset from the reference spectrum.

The algorithm iterates over each spectrum in the workspace and fits a [[Gaussian]] function to the reference peak.  The fit is used to calculate the centre of the fitted peak, and the offset is then calculated as:

This is then written into a [[CalFile|.cal file]] for every detector that contributes to that spectrum.  All of the entries in the cal file are initially set to both be included, but also to all group into a single group on [[DiffractionFocussing]].  The [[CreateCalFileByNames]] algorithm can be used to alter the grouping in the cal file.

=== Fit for peak offset ===
The algorithm to calculate offset of peaks' positions is to
minimize a cost function as
:<math> \sum_{p} |X_{0, p} - (1+offset)\cdot X_{0, p}|/\chi^2_{p} </math>
, which p is the index of a peak whose position is within MinD and MaxD.

==== Spectra to mask ====
* Empty spectrum marked as "empty det"

* Spectrum with counts less than 1.0E^-3 in defined d-range as "dead det"

* Calculated offset exceeds the user-defined maximum offset.

==== Criteria on peaks ====
The (fitted) peak must meet a series of criteria to be used to fit spectrum's offset.

A peak will not be used if
* its centre is out of pre-defined d-range, i.e., MinD and MaxD;
* its centre is out of fitting window if it is defined;
* its <math>\chi^2</math> of peak fitting is larger than pre-defined maximum value;
* its height is lower than pre-defined lowest peak height;
* its signal/noise ratio is less than 5 <math> H\cdot FWHM\_To\_SIGMA/width < 5</math>;
* its height is not outside of error bars of background <math> H < \sqrt{H + B}/2 </math>;
* its z-value on <math>\frac{\delta d}{d} </math> is larger than 2.0.

=== Generate fit window ===
* Required parameter: maxWidth.  If it is not given, i.e., less or equal to zero, then there won't be any window defined;
* Definition of fit window for peaks indexed from 0 to N-1
** Peak 0: window = Min((X0_0-dmin), maxWidth), Min((X0_1-X0_0)/2, maxWidth)
** Peak i (0 < i < N-1): window = Min((X0_i-X0_{i-1})/2, maxWidth), Min((X0_1-X0_0)/2, maxWidth)
** Peak N-1: window = Min((X0_i-X0_{i-1})/2, maxWidth), Min((dmax-X0_i), maxWidth)
where X0_i is the centre of i-th peak.


== Fitting Quality ==
GetDetOffsetsMultiPeaks have 2 levels of fitting.  First it will call FindPeaks to fit Bragg peaks within d-range.
Then it will fit offsets from the peak positions obtained in the previous step.
Therefore, the performance of FindPeaks is critical to this algorithm.
It is necessary to output values reflecting the goodness of fitting of this algorithm to users.

=== Number of spectra that are NOT masked ===
A spectrum will be masked if it is a dead pixel, has an empty detector or has no peak that can be fit with given peak positions.
The performance of ''FindPeaks'' affects the third criteria.
A better algorithm to find and fit peaks may save some spectrum with relatively much fewer events received, i.e., poorer signal.

=== <math>\chi^2</math> of the offset fitting function ===
The goodness of fit, <math>\chi^2_{iws}</math>, of the offset fitting function
:<math> \sum_{p} |X_{0, p} - (1+offset)X_{0, p}|/\chi^2_{p} </math>
is an important measure of fitting quality on each spectrum (indexed as iws).

=== Deviation of highest peaks ===
We observed that in some situation, the calibrated peaks' positions of some spectra are far off to the targeted peak positions,
while goodness of fit such as <math>\chi^2</math> are still good.
It is usally caused by the bad fit of one or two peaks in that spectrum,
which feeds some erroreous peak positions to peak offset fitting function.

This type of bad fitting is very easily identified by visualization,
because the shift of peaks from the correct positions is significant in fill plot.

Therefore, deviation of highest peak if spectrum i, <math>D_{i}</math> is defined as:
:<math> D_{i} = |X^{(o)}\cdots(1+offset) - X^{(c)}|</math>
where <math>X^{(o)}</math> is the fitted centre of the highest peak of spectrum i,
and <math>X^{(c)}</math> is the theoretical centre of this peak.

=== Collective quantities to illustrate goodness of fitting (still in developement) ===
Be noticed that the idea of this section is still under development and has not been implemented  yet.

On the other hand, since GetDetOffsetsMultiPeaks always operates on an EventWorkspace with thousands
or several ten thousands of spectra,
it is very hard to tell the quality of fitting by looking at <math>\chi^2_{iws}</math> of all spectra.
Hence, Here are two other parameters are defined for comparison of results.

: <math>g_1 = \frac{\sum_{s}D_{s}^2}{N_{nm}}</math>
, where s is the index of any unmasked spectrum and <math>N_{mn}</math> is the number of unmasked spectra;

: <math>g_2 = \frac{\sum_{s}D_{s}^2\cdot H_{s}^2}{N_{nm}}</math>,
where <math>H_{s}</math> is the height of highest peak of spectrum s.

=== Standard error on offset ===
The offset in unit of d-spacing differs is proportional to peak's position by definition:
:<math> X_0^{(f)} = X_0^{(o)} * (1+offset) </math>
where <math>X_0^{(f)}</math> is the focussed peak position, and <math>X_0^{(o)}</math> is the observed peak position by fitting.

As different spectrum covers different d-space range, the highest peak differs.
Therefore, the error of offset should be normalized by the peak's position.
:<math> E = (X_0^{(f)} - X_0^{(o)}*(1+offset))/X_0^{(f)} = 1 - \frac{X_0^{(o)}}{X_0^{(f)}}\cdot(1+offset) </math>
And it is unitless.

By this mean, the error of all peaks should be close if they are fitted correctly.
