This algorithm requires a workspace that is both in d-spacing, but has also been preprocessed by the [[CrossCorrelate]] algorithm.  In this first step you select one spectrum to be the reference spectrum and all of the other spectrum are cross correlated against it.  Each output spectrum then contains a peak whose location defines the offset from the reference spectrum.

The algorithm iterates over each spectrum in the workspace and fits a [[Gaussian]] function to the reference peaks.  The fit is used to calculate the centre of the fitted peak, and the offset is then calculated as:

<math>-peakCentre*step/(dreference+PeakCentre*step)</math>

This is then written into a [[CalFile|.cal file]] for every detector that contributes to that spectrum.  All of the entries in the cal file are initially set to both be included, but also to all group into a single group on [[DiffractionFocussing]].  The [[CreateCalFileByNames]] algorithm can be used to alter the grouping in the cal file.
