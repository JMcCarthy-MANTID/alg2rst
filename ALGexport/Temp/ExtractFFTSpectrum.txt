This algorithm iterates the [[FFT]] algorithm on each spectrum of InputWorkspace, computing the Fourier Transform and storing the transformed spectrum in OutputWorkspace. If InputImagWorkspace is also passed, then the pair spectrum ''i'' of InputWorkspace (real) and spectrum ''i'' of InputImagWorkspace (real) are taken together as spectrum ''i'' of a complex workspace, on which [[FFT]] is applied.

The FFTPart parameter specifies which transform is selected from the output of the [[FFT]] algorithm:
