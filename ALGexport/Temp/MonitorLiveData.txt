The MonitorLiveData algorithm is started in the background
by [[StartLiveData]] and repeatedly calls [[LoadLiveData]].
'''It should not be necessary to call MonitorLiveData directly.'''

This algorithm simply calls [[LoadLiveData]] at the given ''UpdateFrequency''.
For more details, see [[StartLiveData]].

For details on the way to specify the data processing steps, see: [[LoadLiveData#Description|LoadLiveData]].
