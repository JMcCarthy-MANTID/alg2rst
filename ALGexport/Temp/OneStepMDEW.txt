This algorithm is used in the Paraview event nexus loader to both load an event nexus file and convert it into a [[MDEventWorkspace]] for use in visualization.

The [[LoadEventNexus]] algorithm is called with default parameters to load into an [[EventWorkspace]].

After, the [[MakeDiffractionMDEventWorkspace]] algorithm is called with the new EventWorkspace as input. The parameters are set to convert to Q in the lab frame, with Lorentz correction, and default size/splitting behavior parameters.
