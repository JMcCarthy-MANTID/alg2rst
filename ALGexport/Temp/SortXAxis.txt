Clones the input [[MatrixWorkspace|Matrix Workspaces]] and orders the x-axis in an ascending fashion. Ensures that the y-axis and error data is sorted in a consistent way with the x-axis.

This algorithm is for use with small workspaces loaded. It is particularly suitable for reformatting workspaces loaded via [[LoadASCII]]. Input workspaces must be a distribution.
