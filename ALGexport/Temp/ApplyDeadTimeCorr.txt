Apply deadtime correction to each spectra of a workspace. Define:

  <math>{\displaystyle{N}}</math> = true count
  <math>{\displaystyle{M}}</math> = measured count
  <math>{\displaystyle{t_{dead}}}</math> = dead-time
  <math>{\displaystyle{t_{bin}}}</math> = time bin width
  <math>{\displaystyle{F}}</math> = Number of good frames

Then this algorithm assumes that the InputWorkspace contains measured counts as a
function of TOF and returns a workspace containing true counts as a function of the
same TOF binning according to

:<math> N = \frac{M}{(1-M*(\frac{t_{dead}}{t_{bin}*F}))} </math>
