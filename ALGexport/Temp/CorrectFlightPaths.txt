Corrects the flight paths of a flat detector.
Both TOF sample-detector and distance sample-detector are corrected to constant values, i.e., this algorithm make the detector spherical rather than flat.

detector_distance must exist in the <instrument>_Parameters.xml:

So far this has only be tested on ILL IN5.
