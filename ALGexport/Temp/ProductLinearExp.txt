This fit function computes the product of a linear and exponential function. See [[ExpDecay]]
and [[LinearBackground]] for details on the component functions.

<math> (\mbox{A0}+\mbox{A1}\times x) \times  \mbox{Height}\times \exp(-\frac{x}{\mbox{Lifetime}}) </math>

This function may be used with the [[Fit]] algorithm. However, it was originally added to
Mantid as a named function for the purposes of detector efficiency calibration.
