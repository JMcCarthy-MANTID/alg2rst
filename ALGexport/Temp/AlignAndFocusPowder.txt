This is a workflow algorithm that does the bulk of the work for time focusing diffraction data. This is done by executing several sub-algorithms as listed below.

# [[RemovePromptPulse]] (event workspace only)
# [[CompressEvents]] (event workspace only)
# [[CropWorkspace]]
# [[MaskDetectors]]
# [[Rebin]] or [[ResampleX]] if not d-space binning
# [[AlignDetectors]]
# If LRef, minwl, or DIFCref are specified:
## [[ConvertUnits]] to time-of-flight
## [[UnwrapSNS]]
## [[RemoveLowResTOF]]
## [[ConvertUnits]] to d-spacing
# [[Rebin]] if d-space binning
# [[DiffractionFocussing]]
# [[SortEvents]] (event workspace only)
# [[EditInstrumentGeometry]] (if appropriate)
# [[ConvertUnits]] to time-of-f
