This algorithm is for producing rocking curves from alignment scan runs. It is for use only with ADARA-style SNS datasets as it requires the 'scan_index' log variable.
  
The algorithm optionally uses the [[MaskDetectors]] and/or [[FilterByXValue]] algorithms to restrict the region of data included.
'''N.B. If these options are used, then this algorithm will modify the input workspace.'''

The [[SumEventsByLogValue]] algorithm is then called, with 'scan_index' as the log to sum against. 
The row of the resulting table pertaining to scan_index=0 (which indicates 'not a scan point') is then removed.
