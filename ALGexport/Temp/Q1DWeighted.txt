Performs azimuthal averaging for a 2D SANS data set by going through each detector pixel, determining its Q-value, and adding its amplitude <math>I</math> to the appropriate Q bin. For greater precision, each detector pixel can be sub-divided in sub-pixels by setting the ''NPixelDivision'' parameters. Each pixel has a weight of 1 by default, but the weight of each pixel can be set to <math>1/\Delta I^2</math> by setting the ''ErrorWeighting'' parameter to True.


See the [http://www.mantidproject.org/Rebin Rebin] documentation for details about choosing the ''OutputBinning'' parameter.
