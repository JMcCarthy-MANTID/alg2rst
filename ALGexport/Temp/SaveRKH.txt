Saves the the given workspace to a file which will be formatted in one of the LOQ data formats (see [http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/archive/LargeScale/LOQ/other/formats.htm here]).
1D or 2D workspaces may be saved. If a 1D workspace is 'horizontal' (a single spectrum) then the first column in the three column output will contain the X values of the spectrum (giving the bin centre if histogram data). For a 'vertical' (single column) 1D workspace, the first column of the file will contain the spectrum number.
