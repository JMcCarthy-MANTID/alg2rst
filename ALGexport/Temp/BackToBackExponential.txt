A back-to-back exponential peakshape function is defined as:

:<math>  I\frac{AB}{2(A+B)}\left[ \exp \left( \frac{A[AS^2+2(x-X0)]}{2}\right) \mbox{erfc}\left( \frac{AS^2+(x-X0)}{S\sqrt{2}} \right) + \exp \left( \frac{B[BS^2-2(x-X0)]}{2} \right) \mbox{erfc} \left( \frac{[BS^2-(x-X0)]}{S\sqrt{2}} \right) \right]. </math>

This peakshape function represent the convolution of back-to-back exponentials and a gaussian function and is designed to
be used for the data analysis of time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction data, see Ref. 1.

The parameters <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> represent the absolute value of the exponential rise and decay constants (modelling the neutron pulse coming from the moderator)
and <math>S</math> represent the standard deviation of the gaussian. The parameter <math>X0</math> is the location of the peak; more specifically it represent
the point where the exponentially modelled neutron pulse goes from being exponentially rising to exponentially decaying. <math>I</math> is the integrated intensity.
