The LoadEventPreNeXus algorithm stores data from the pre-nexus neutron event data file in an [[EventWorkspace]]. The default histogram bin boundaries consist of a single bin able to hold all events (in all pixels), and will have their [[units]] set to time-of-flight. Since it is an [[EventWorkspace]], it can be rebinned to finer bins with no loss of data.

=== Optional properties ===
Specific pulse ID and mapping files can be specified if needed; these are guessed at automatically from the neutron filename, if not specified.
