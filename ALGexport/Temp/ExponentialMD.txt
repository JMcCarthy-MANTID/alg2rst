This executes the exponential function on a MDHistoWorkspace.

The signal <math>a</math> becomes <math> f = e^a </math>

The error <math>da</math> becomes <math> df^2 = f^2 * da^2 </math>

This algorithm cannot be run on a [[MDEventWorkspace]]. Its equivalent on a [[MatrixWorkspace]] is called [[Exponential]].
