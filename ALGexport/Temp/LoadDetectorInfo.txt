The detection time delay for each detector is subtracted from the time of flight bin boundaries in the spectrum associated with that detector. It is required that all the monitors have the same time delay and if this is non-zero the delay time is added to all TOF values. It is important that the units of the input workspace are TOF in microseconds, that [[GroupDetectors]] has not been run and this algorithm is only applied once to a workspace.

Values for the partial pressure of 3He and wall thickness are added into the parameter map for each detector in a form that can be read by [[DetectorEfficiencyCor]]. That is, the values are assumed to be in atmosheres and meters, respectively, and the properties are stored internally in the workspace parameter map as "3He(atm)" and "wallT(m)".  The values are likely to be read from the same RAW file that the workspace was loaded from or a DAT file that corrosponds to the same run or series of experimental runs.

Spectra whose associated detector data are not found in the input DAT or RAW file will not have their time of flight bin boundaries adjusted. Similarly nothing will be written to the parameter map for those detectors, the algorithm will continue to process data as normal but a warning will be written to the log. Detectors that are listed in the input file but do not exist in the instrument definition file will be ignored and details will be written to the log.

If all the time offsets are the same and the file ''appears'' to contain enough data for all detectors all detector spectra will use same bin boundaries, where possible. This will make the algorithm run much more quickly and use less memory.

When using a RAW file the time offset for each detector is read from the "hold off" table in the file's header while pressure and wall thickness data must be present in the user table array. The format for .DAT files is specified in the document "DETECTOR.DAT format" written by Prof G Toby Perring ("detector format.doc")

If the RelocateDets option is set to true, it is false by default, then the detectors are moved to the corresponding positions specified in the data file provided.

=== Detectors.dat data format ===

The the detector data can be stored as ASCII or [http://download.nexusformat.org/ NeXus] data file. The description of the ASCII DETECTOR.dat file is provided in the table below. Nexus file format can come in two flavours. The first one is completely equivalent to the ASCII 19 column data format and introduced to increase the speed of accessing these data in binary format, where the second one left for compatibility with Libisis. It has meaningful data corresponding to the columns 1-6, 17&18 below, but does not support multiple tube pressures and wall thickness. 

The [[LoadDetectorInfo]] algorithm currently reads and interprets rows 1-6,17&18 of the table, provided below (or columns of det.dat file) or correspondent data blocks from the NeXus file. It also does not understand the short (15 columns) MARI detector.dat ASCII file format (see '''ISIS detector.dat files''' below). 

==== Co-ordinate frames ====

For the purposes of the detector table we choose a right handed set of axes fixed in the spectrometer:

      x-axis  -- horizontal
      y-axis  -- vertical
      z-axis  -- parallel to ki

Centres of each detector element are defined in spherical polar co-ordinates as seen from the sample position:

  THETA Polar angle measured from the z-axis [what we would normally call the scattering angle PHI]. Note that  0< THETA <180
  PHI   Azimuthal angle measured from the x-axis in a right handed sense [what TGP, CDF	and RD01 call -BETA].
        For example, the West Bank of HET has PHI=0, the North Bank has PHI=90, the South Bank has PHI=270.

To specify the orientation of a detector, define axes x', y', z' as follows:

    x'-axis	increasing THETA
    y'-axis	increasing PHI
    z'-axis	parallel to the line joining sample and detector

The natural coordinate frame for the detector, xd, yd, zd, may not coincide with x', y', z'. For example, the natural frame for a gas tube is with zd along the axis of the tube, and the direction of xd chosen to be perpendicular to the line joining the detector with the sample. The characteristic dimensions of the detector, W_x, W_y, W_z, are given in the frame xd, yd, zd.

The detector coordinate axes xd, yd, zd are related to x', y', z' by a rotation. The transformation is be expressed by a three-component vector &alpha;<sub>x</sub>, &alpha;<sub>y</sub>, &alpha;<sub>z</sub>, where the magnitude of  the vector gives the angle of rotation in a right-hand sense, and the normalised elements give the components along x', y', z' of the unit vector about which the rotation takes place. The magnitude of the vector is in degrees. 

     e.g. non-PSD gas tube on the Debye-Scherrer cone:
       &alpha;<sub>x</sub> = -90<sup>0</sup>, &alpha;<sub>y</sub> = &alpha;<sub>z</sub> = 0<sup>0</sup>; Wx = Wy = 0.0254, Wz = 0.300

    e.g. Davidson bead monitor filling the HET beam at the monitor_2 position:
        &alpha;<sub>x</sub> = &alpha;<sub>y</sub> = &alpha;<sub>z</sub> = 0<sup>0</sup>; Wx = Wy = 0.045, Wz = 0.00025

Note that for PSD detectors the angles and dimensions refer to the pixel, not the whole tube. For HET, Wz = 0.914/64 = 0.01428.

==== File format ====
The file consists of number of ASCII columns, separated by spaces. All distances are in meters, and all angles in degrees.

|Frequently, some of the inputs to the data acquisition electronics do not have any detectors plugged into them. To ensure that any noise on these inputs is safely directed to a ‘dust-bin’ spectrum, they are given detector numbers which are associated with spectrum 0 in SPECTRA.DAT.  Dummy entries in DETECTOR.DAT are required for each of these dummy detectors. These entries should be given detector CODE = 0, which will be used to indicate that the other entries in DETECTOR.DAT can be ignored. For the sake of clarity, set all DELTA, L2...DET_4 to zero for dummy detectors.
