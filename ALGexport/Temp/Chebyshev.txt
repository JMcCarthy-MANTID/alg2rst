This function calculates a partial Chebyshev expansion

:<math> \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T_n(a+bx) </math>

where <math> a_n </math> are the expansion coefficients and <math> T_n(x) </math> are
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind defined by the reccurence relation

:<math>T_0(x)=1 \,\!</math>

:<math>T_1(x)=x \,\!</math>

:<math>T_{n+1}(x)= 2xT_n(x)-T_{n-1}(x) \,\!</math>

Coefficients <math> a </math> and <math> b </math> are defined to map the fitting interval
into [-1,1] interval.

Chebyshev function has tree attributes (non-fitting parameters). First is 'n' which has
integer type and sets the expansion order and creates n+1 expansion coefficients (fitting
parameters). The parameter names have the form 'Ai' where 'A' is letter 'A' and 'i' is the
parameter's index starting from 0.

The other two attributes are doubles 'StartX' and 'EndX' which define the expansion (fitting) interval.
