The workspace data are stored in the file in columns: the first column contains the X-values, followed by pairs of Y and E values. Columns are separated by commas. The resulting file can normally be loaded into a workspace by the [[LoadAscii2]] algorithm.

==== Limitations ====
The algorithm assumes that the workspace has common X values for all spectra (i.e. is not a [[Ragged Workspace|ragged workspace]]). Only the X values from the first spectrum in the workspace are saved out.
