The SPB struct within an ISIS raw file defines 4 fields that describe the basic geometry of the sample:
* e_geom;
* e_thick; 
* e_height; 
* e_width.

The meaning of the last three are dependent on the flag value ''e_geom'', which defines the sample shape as one of 4 basic shapes: 
* 1 = cylinder: radius = e_thick = e_width, height = e_height;
* 2 = flat plate: as named;
* 3 = disc: radius = e_width, thickness = e_thick;  
* 4 = single crystal.

The values are stored on the [http://doxygen.mantidproject.org/classMantid_1_1API_1_1Sample.html#a07df5ce7be639c3cb67f33f5e1c7493f sample] object.

== Access in Python ==
To access these values in Python:
 sampleInfo = wksp.getSampleInfo()
 print sampleInfo.getGeometryFlag()
 print sampleInfo.getThickness()
 print sampleInfo.getHeight()
 print sampleInfo.getWidth()

where wksp is a handle to a Mantid workspace.
