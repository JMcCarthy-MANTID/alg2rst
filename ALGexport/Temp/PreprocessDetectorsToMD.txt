PreprocessDetectorsToMD is helper algorithm, used to make general part of transformation from real to reciprocal space. 
It is used by ConvertToMD algorithm to save time on this transformation when the algorithm used multiple times for the same instrument. 
It is also should be used to calculate limits of transformation in Q-space and the detectors trajectories in Q-space. 

The result of this algorithm do in fact define an "ideal instrument", which is used to convert experimental data into the reciprocal space.
Additional purpose of '''PreprocessDetectorsToMD''' is to return these data in the form, which can be easy extracted, observed and modified 
to see and check all corrections done to the real instrument before starting transformation from the experiment's(instrument) space to the 
target physical space. 

== Output Table Workspace Description ==

Table workspace obtained from the algorithm is the table workspace with properties, containing the following information:

!Description
|-
|DetDirections
|V3D
|Always
|Unit vectors pointing from sample to detector's positions
|-

|Sample-detector distances
|-
|TwoTheta
|double
|Always
|Sampe-detector polar angle (2''&theta;'', diffraction angle)
|-
|Azimuthal
|double
|Always
|Sampe-detector azimuthal angle 
|-
|DetectorID
|int32_t
|Always
|The unique ID specific to the detector or group of detectors.  
|-
|detIDMap
|size_t
|Always
|Spectra index which corresponds to a valid detector index.  ''detIDMap[liveDetectorsCount]= WorkspaceIndex'';
|-
|spec2detMap
|size_t
|Always
|The detector's index corresponding to the workspace index. It is the value used to match the spectra obtained from the workspace to the values of detector's parameters defined in this table. ''spec2detMap[WorkspaceIndex]= liveDetectorsCount'';
|-
|detMask
|int 
|if GetMaskState==true
|The vector containing 1 for masked spectra and 0 for not masked. <span style="color:#FF0000"> This is temporary solution necessary until Mantid masks signal by 0 rather then NaN</span>
|-
|eFixed
|float
|if GetEFixed==true
|Input energy on a detector from Indirect instrument, copied value of '''Ei''' or '''eFixed''' property on other instruments or NaN if nothing is defined
|}


The workspace also has the following properties attached to it:

!Property Name
!Type
!Description
|-
|InstrumentName
|string
|The name which should uniquely identify current instrument
|-
|L1
|double
|L1 is the source to sample distance
|-
|Ei
|double
|Incident energy for Direct or Crystal-Analyser energy for Indirect instruments copied from '''Ei''' (first) or '''eFixed''' (if '''Ei''' is undefined) property of the input workspace. '''NaN''' if no energy property is found. 
|-
|ActualDetectorsNum
|uint32_t
|The actual number of detectors receiving signal (This is the number of instrument's detectors minus monitors and masked detectors)
|-
|FakeDetectors
|bool.
|Usually false and specifies if the detectors were actually processed for real instrument or generated for some fake one when the detector information has been lost. The detector information considered lost when the input matrix workspace has numeric Y-axis.
