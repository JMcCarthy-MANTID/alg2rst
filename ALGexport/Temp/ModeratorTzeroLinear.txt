This algorithm Corrects the time of flight (TOF) of an indirect geometry instrument by substracting a time offset <math>t_0</math>
linearly dependent on the wavelenght of the neutron when emitted through the moderator. This algorithm is suitable to data reduction
of indirect instruments featuring a neutron flux with a narrow distribution of wavelenghts.
A heuristic formula for the correction, stored in the instrument definition file, is taken as linear on the initial
neutron wavelength <math>\lambda_i</math>:
<math>t_0 = a * \lambda_i + b</math>, [a]=microsec/Angstrom and [b]=microsec.
Below is the example XML code included in BASIS beamline parameters file.

<pre>
<!-- Moderator Tzero/LambdaZero Parameters  -->
<parameter name="Moderator.TimeZero.Gradient">
    <value val="11.967"/>
</parameter>
<parameter name="Moderator.TimeZero.Intercept">
    <value val="-5.0"/>
</parameter>
</pre>

The recorded TOF: <math>TOF = t_0 + t_i + t_f</math>, with
* <math>t_0</math>: emission time from the moderator
* <math>t_i</math>: time from moderator to sample
*  <math>t_f</math>: time from sample to detector

This algorithm will replace TOF with <math>TOF' = TOF-t_0 = t_i + t_f</math>

For an indirect geometry instrument, <math>\lambda_i</math> is not known but the final energy, <math>E_f</math>,
selected by the analyzers is known. For this geometry:
* <math>t_f = L_f/v_f</math>, with <math>L_f</math>: distance from sample to detector, <math>v_f</math>: final velocity derived from <math>E_f</math>
* <math>t_i = L_i/v_i</math>, with <math>L_i</math>: distance from moderator to sample, <math>v_i</math>: initial velocity unknown
* <math>t_0 = a'/v_i+b'</math>, with a' and b'  constants derived from the aforementioned heuristic formula <math>a' = a \cdot 3.956 \cdot 10^{-3}</math> with [a']=meter,
and <math>b' = b</math> with [b']=microsec

Putting all together:  <math>TOF' = \frac{L_i}{L_i+a'} \cdot (TOF-t_f-b') + t_f</math>, with [TOF']=microsec

If the detector is a monitor, then we can treat it as both sample and detector. Thus, we use the previous formula inserting the time from sample
to detector <math>t_f = 0</math> and with the initial fligh path <math>L_i</math> as the distance from source to monitor.
