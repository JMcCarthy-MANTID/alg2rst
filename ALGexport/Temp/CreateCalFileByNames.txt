Create a [[CalFile|calibration file]] for diffraction focusing based on list of names of the instrument tree.

If a new file name is specified then offsets in the file are all sets to zero and all detectors are selected. 
If a valid calibration file already exists at the location specified by the [[CalFile|GroupingFileName]] 
then any existing offsets and selection values will be maintained and only the grouping values changed.

Detectors not assigned to any group will appear as group 0, i.e. not included when using AlignDetector or DiffractionFocussing algorithms.

The group number is assigned based on a descent in the instrument tree assembly.
If two assemblies are parented, say Bank1 and module1, and both assembly names
are given in the GroupNames, they will get assigned different grouping numbers.
This allows to isolate a particular sub-assembly of a particular leaf of the tree.
