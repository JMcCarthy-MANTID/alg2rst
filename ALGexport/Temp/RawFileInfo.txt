Extracts run parameters from the [[RAW_File | RAW]] file given as an input property. If the ''GetRunParameters'' argument is ''True'' then a TableWorkspace is created that contains a column for each value of the RPB_STRUCT, i.e. column names such as r_dur, r_goodfrm etc. This is Mantid's version of the '''Get''' routine in Open Genie.
