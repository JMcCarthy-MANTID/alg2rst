Intended for use on data from engineering beamlines, this algorithm creates a shape object for use as the 'gauge volume' (i.e. the portion of the sample that is visible
to the detectors in a given run) of a larger sample in the
[[AbsorptionCorrection]] algorithm. The sample shape will also need to be defined using, e.g., the [[CreateSampleShape]] algorithm. Shapes are defined using XML descriptions that can be found [[HowToDefineGeometricShape|here]]. 

Internally, this works by attaching the XML string (after validating it) to a property called "GaugeVolume" on the workspace's [[Run]] object.
