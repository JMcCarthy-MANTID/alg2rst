Performs index operations on a workspace which involve cropping out spectra and summing spectra together. See [[MultiFileLoading]] for similar syntax used during loading, though operations
using step sizes are not supported here.

 |-
 !align="center" |List
 |align="center" |<code><workspace_index>,<workspace_index></code>
 |Used to list workspace_indexes to keep.
 |<code>0,1,2</code>
 |Keeps spectrum with workspace indexes 0,1,2 others are cropped out.
 |-
 !align="center" |Plus
 |align="center" |<code><workspace_index>+<workspace_index></code>
 |Used to specify which spectrum are to be summed together via [[SumSpectra]]. For summing ranges use ''Added Range''
 |<code>1+2</code>
 |Sum spectrum with workspace indexes 1, 2 together.
 |-
 !align="center" |Range
 |align="center" |<code><workspace_index>:<workspace_index></code>
 |Used to specify a range of N spectrum to keep.
 |<code>0:4</code>
 |Keeps spectrum with workspace indexes between 0 and 4.
 |-
 !align="center" |Added Range
 |align="center" |<code><workspace_index>-<workspace_index></code>
 |Used to specify a range of spectrum that are to be summed together via [[SumSpectra]]. This is an alternative to the binary ''Plus'' operator.
 |<code>1-4</code>
 |Sum spectra corresponding to the workspace indexes between 1 and 4.

== Complex Instructions ==

The basic instructions listed above can be used in combination because ''', can be used to separate out sets of instructions as well as indexes to keep'''. 
For example, ''0-2, 3:6'' will add
spectrum with workspace indexes 0-2 together into a single spectrum and then append spectra that correspond to 
workspace indexes 3-6 from the original workspace (you will have 4 spectra
in the output workspace).

== Limitations ==

* The ''+'' operator is binary only and works like 0+1, but cannot be used like 0+1+2. Use the Add Range operator ''-'' in these scenarios.

== Order of operations ==
The spectra will appear in the output workspace in the same order that they are defined in the instructions. 
For example ''1+2, 0'' will have the results of 1+2 as workspace index 0 in the output
workspace and index 0 in the original workspace will be mapped to workspace index 1 in the output workspace.
