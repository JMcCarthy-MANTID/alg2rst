The ISIS TS1 instrument [http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/instruments/loq/ LOQ] writes values for the moderator-sample and sample-detector distances to the RAW data file. These distances are required for correct data reduction. This algorithm extracts the information from the <code>i_l1</code> and <code>i_sddist</code> variables of the IVPB struct respectively and moves the appropriate components so that the Mantid instrument satisfies these values.
