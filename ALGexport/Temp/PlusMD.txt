This algorithm sums two [[MDHistoWorkspace]]s or merges two [[MDEventWorkspace]]s together.

=== MDHistoWorkspaces ===

* '''MDHistoWorkspace + MDHistoWorkspace'''
** The operation is performed element-by-element.
* '''MDHistoWorkspace + Scalar''' or '''Scalar + MDHistoWorkspace'''
** The scalar is subtracted from every element of the MDHistoWorkspace. The squares of errors are summed.

=== MDEventWorkspaces ===

This algorithm operates similary to calling Plus on two [[EventWorkspace]]s: it combines the events from the two workspaces together to form one large workspace.

==== Note for file-backed workspaces ====

The algorithm uses [[CloneMDWorkspace]] to create the output workspace, except when adding in place (e.g. <math> A = A + B </math> ).
See [[CloneMDWorkspace]] for details, but note that a file-backed [[MDEventWorkspace]] will have its file copied.

* If A is in memory and B is file-backed, the operation <math> C = A + B </math> will clone the B file-backed workspace and add A to it.
* However, the operation <math> A = A + B </math> will clone the A workspace and add B into memory (which might be too big!)

Also, be aware that events added to a MDEventWorkspace are currently added '''in memory''' and are not cached to file until [[SaveMD]]
or another algorithm requiring it is called. The workspace is marked as 'requiring file update'.
