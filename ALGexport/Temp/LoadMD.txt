This algorithm loads a [[MDEventWorkspace]] that was previously
saved using the [[SaveMD]] algorithm to a .nxs file format.

If the workspace is too large to fit into memory,
You can load the workspace as a [[MDWorkspace#File-Backed MDWorkspaces|file-backed MDWorkspace]]
by checking the FileBackEnd option. This will load the box structure
(allowing for some visualization with no speed penalty) but leave the
events on disk until requested. Processing file-backed MDWorkspaces
is significantly slower than in-memory workspaces due to frequency file access!

For file-backed workspaces, the Memory option allows you to specify a cache
size, in MB, to keep events in memory before caching to disk.

Finally, the BoxStructureOnly and MetadataOnly options are for special situations
and used by other algorithms, they should not be needed in daily use.
