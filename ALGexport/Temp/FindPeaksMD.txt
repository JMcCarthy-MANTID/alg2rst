This algorithm is used to find single-crystal peaks in a multi-dimensional workspace ([[MDEventWorkspace]] or [[MDHistoWorkspace]]).
It looks for high signal density areas, and is based on an algorithm designed by Dennis Mikkelson for ISAW.

The algorithm proceeds in this way:
* Sorts all the boxes in the workspace by decreasing order of signal density (total weighted event sum divided by box volume).
** It will skip any boxes with a density below a threshold. The threshold is <math>TotalSignal / TotalVolume * DensityThresholdFactor</math>.
* The centroid of the strongest box is considered a peak.
* The centroid of the next strongest box is calculated. 
** We look through all the peaks that have already been found. If the box is too close to an existing peak, it is rejected. This distance is PeakDistanceThreshold.
* This is repeated until we find up to MaxPeaks peaks.

Each peak created is placed in the output [[PeaksWorkspace]], which can be a new workspace or replace the old one.

This algorithm works on a [[MDHistoWorkspace]] resulting from the [[BinMD]] algorithm also.
It works in the same way, except that the center of each bin is used since the centroid is not accessible.
It may give better results on [[Workspace2D]]'s that were converted to [[MDWorkspace]]s.
