The process for this algorithm is:
* The standard deviation for each pixel within the pre-set range is calculated.
* The mean value and standard deviation of these standard deviation values is calculated.
* Any detector/pixel for which it's standard deviation value satisfied the following conditions:
** sdev(pixel) < mean(sdevs) - 3 * sdev(sdevs)
** sdev(pixel) > mean(sdevs) + 3 * sdev(sdevs)
** sdev(pixel) < mean(sdevs) * 0.0001
* (cont) is considered to be "noisy".

This is repeated three times from the second step.

This uses the [[Integration]], [[Power]] and [[Divide]] algorithms for the first step.

The lower bound for the integration is currently fixed to 2000.

The upper bound for the integration is currently fixed to 19000.
