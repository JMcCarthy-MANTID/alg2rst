Create a dummy [[CalFile|calibration file]] for diffraction focusing with one group.

Offsets in the file are all sets to zero and all detectors are selected. Overwrites a calibration file that already exists at the location specified.

Detectors will be assigned to group one when using AlignDetector or DiffractionFocussing algorithms.
