This executes the power function on a MDHistoWorkspace.

The signal <math>a</math> becomes <math> f = a^b </math>

The error <math>da</math> becomes <math> df^2 = f^2 * b^2 * (da^2 / a^2) </math>

This algorithm cannot be run on a [[MDEventWorkspace]]. Its equivalent on a [[MatrixWorkspace]] is called [[Power]].
