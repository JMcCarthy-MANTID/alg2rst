This algorithm is used to save the masking from a workspace to an XML file. 
This algorithm has previously been renamed from [[SaveDetectorMasks]].

== 2 Types of Mask Workspace ==
There are two types of mask workspace that can serve as input. 

==== 1. [[MaskWorkspace]] ====
In this case, [[SaveMask]] will read Y values to determine which detectors are masked;
 
==== 2. A non-[[MaskWorkspace]] [[MatrixWorkspace]] containing [[Instrument]] ====  
In this case, [[SaveMask]] will scan through all detectors to determine which are masked.

== Definition of Mask ==
 * If a pixel is masked, it means that the data from this pixel won't be used.  
   In the masking workspace (i.e., [[SpecialWorkspace2D]]), the corresponding value is 1. 
 * If a pixel is NOT masked, it means that the data from this pixel will be used.  
   In the masking workspace (i.e., [[SpecialWorkspace2D]]), the corresponding value is 0.

== XML File Format ==
Example 1: 

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
  <detector-masking">
   <group">
    <detids>3,34-44,47</detids>
    <component>bank123</component>
    <component>bank124</component>
   </group>
  </detector-masking>
