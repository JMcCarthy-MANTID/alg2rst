The LoadRaw algorithm stores data from the [[RAW_File | RAW]] file in a [[Workspace2D]], which will naturally contain histogram data with each spectrum going into a separate histogram. The time bin boundaries (X values) will be common to all histograms and will have their [[units]] set to time-of-flight. The Y values will contain the counts and will be unit-less (i.e. no division by bin width or normalisation of any kind). The errors, currently assumed Gaussian, will be set to be the square root of the number of counts in the bin.

=== Optional properties ===
If only a portion of the data in the [[RAW_File | RAW]] file is required, then the optional 'spectrum' properties can be set before execution of the algorithm. Prior to loading of the data the values provided are checked and the algorithm will fail if they are found to be outside the limits of the dataset.

=== Multiperiod data === 
If the RAW file contains multiple periods of data this will be detected and the different periods will be output as separate workspaces, which after the first one will have the period number appended (e.g. OutputWorkspace_period).
Each workspace will share the same [[Instrument]], SpectraToDetectorMap and [[Sample]] objects.
If the optional 'spectrum' properties are set for a multiperiod dataset, then they will ignored.

===Subalgorithms used===
LoadRaw runs the following algorithms as child algorithms to populate aspects of the output [[Workspace]]:
* [[LoadInstrument]] - Looks for an instrument definition file named XXX_Definition.xml, where XXX is the 3 letter instrument prefix on the RAW filename, in the directory specified by the "instrumentDefinition.directory" property given in the config file (or, if not provided, in the relative path ../Instrument/). If the instrument definition file is not found then the [[LoadInstrumentFromRaw]] algorithm will be run instead.
* [[LoadMappingTable]] - To build up the mapping between the spectrum numbers and the Detectors of the attached [[Instrument]].
* [[LoadLog]] - Will look for any log files in the same directory as the RAW file and load their data into the workspace's [[Sample]] object.

==Previous Versions==
LoadRaw version 1 and 2 are no longer available in Mantid.  Version 3 has been validated and in active use for several years, if you really need a previous version of this algorithm you will need to use an earlier version of Mantid.
